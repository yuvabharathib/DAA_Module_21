# EX 3A Knight Tour & Count Path
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to find minimum steps to reach to specific cell in minimum moves by knight


## Algorithm
1. Define the dimensions of the matrix `R` and `C` (rows and columns), and set `MAX_K` as the maximum value for `k`.  
2. Define a recursive function `pathCountDPRecDP` that computes the number of paths to reach the bottom-right corner from the top-left corner, with the exact sum `k`.  
3. If `m < 0`, `n < 0`, or `k < 0`, return 0 as these are invalid paths.  
4. If the current cell `(m, n)` is the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and the sum `k` equals `mat[m][n]`, return 1 (a valid path).  
5. If the result for the current state `(m, n, k)` is already computed (i.e., `dp[m][n][k] != -1`), return the cached result.  
6. Otherwise, recursively compute the number of paths by considering two possible moves:  
   (I)Move up by decreasing `m` by 1, with the new sum being `k - mat[m][n]`.  
   (II)Move left by decreasing `n` by 1, with the new sum being `k - mat[m][n]`.  
7. Store the result of the recursive calls in `dp[m][n][k]`.  
8. Define the function `pathCountDP` that calls `pathCountDPRecDP` starting from the bottom-right corner `(R - 1, C - 1)` with the target sum `k`.  
9. Initialize the `dp` table with all values set to `-1` to indicate that no values have been computed.  
10. Call the `pathCountDP` function with the matrix and the target sum `k`, and print the result.
