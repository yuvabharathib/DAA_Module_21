# EX 3C Sudoku Solver
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the solution of sudoku puzzle using Backtracking.


## Algorithm
1. Start from the first empty cell on the board.
2. Try placing values from 1 to 9 in the cell, one by one.
3. For each value, check if placing it violates Sudoku rules (row, column, and subgrid uniqueness).
4. If a valid value is found, place it and recursively try to solve the next empty cell.
5. If no value is valid, backtrack by resetting the cell and trying the next possible value.
6. Continue until the board is completely filled or no solution exists.   

## Program:
```python
